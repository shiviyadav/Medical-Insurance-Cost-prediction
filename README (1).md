# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

This medical insurance machine learning project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating healthcare insurance costs.



## Introduction

In the project, the fundamental machine learning techniques are applied to predict whether students, under specific circumstances, would pass their tests. The steps undertaken include:

Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, addressing issues like missing values and inconsistencies.

Data Visualization: Visualizations such as histograms and box plots were used to explore the data and identify patterns and correlations.

Feature Engineering: New features were created or existing ones were transformed to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Model Training: Linear Regression were tained using preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each trained model was assessed using various evaluation metrics.


Model Validation: The chosen SVM model was validated to ensure its generalizability and performance in real-world scenarios.

These steps represent a structured approach to prediction and analysis.


Machine learning Algorithm

After defining the metrics, the project involves training three classifiers:
- Linear Regression -Evaluation Metrics: Common evaluation metrics for linear regression models include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.

- Train and test split



## Accuracy of Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of machine learning, linear regression aims to fit a linear equation to observed data points, allowing for the prediction of the dependent variable based on the independent variables.R squared vale :  0.744
